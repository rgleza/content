#### Scripts

##### New: FindAllIPs
This script will look for potential IPs in text when they are appended or prepended with other strings eg:
Block this IP: 127.0.0.1Thanks --> 127.0.0.1
Please remove the following IP from the EDL List:127.0.0.1 Thanks --> 127.0.0.1
The logic is based on the following script: https://github.com/greaselovely/network.bits/blob/main/ip_getter.py
 (Available from Cortex XSOAR 6.8.0).
